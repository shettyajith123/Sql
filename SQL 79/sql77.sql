Write a query to return Territory and corresponding Sales Growth. Compare growth between periods Q4-2021 vs Q3-2021. If Territory (say T123) has Sales worth $100 in Q3-2021 and Sales worth $110 in Q4-2021, then the Sales Growth will be 10% [ i.e. = ((110 - 100)/100) * 100 ]

Output the ID of the Territory and the Sales Growth. Only output these territories that had any sales in both quarters.

🌀By solving this, you'll learn how to use Cte, Group by, Join, Agg function. Give it a try and share the output! 👇

1. The CTE QuarterlySales aggregates sales at the territory level for Q3 and Q4 of 2021. It filters sales between July 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021.

2. The main query: Joins Q4 sales (quarter = 4) with Q3 sales (quarter = 3) based on the territory_id. Calculates percentage growth using the formula:
Sales Growth (%)=Q3Sales(Q4Sales−Q3Sales)​×100

with cte as(
select fc.*,mct.territory_id,DATEPART(QUARTER, order_Date) AS Quarter ,
round(1.0*100*(lead(order_value,1,order_value) over(partition by fc.cust_id order by order_date)-order_value)/order_value,1) as increase_percent
from fct_customer_sale fc
join map_customer_territories mct
on fc.cust_id=mct.cust_id
where DATEPART(QUARTER, order_Date) in (3,4)
)
Select territory_id,max(increase_percent) as [Sales Growth]
from cte
group by territory_id
